# AMWA IS-06 NMOS Network Control Specification

IS-06 is an AMWA NMOS Specification for API control of a managed network.

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifcations.

The formal IS-06 specification is provided at in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-network-control). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which are specified in RAML and JSON Schema).

The links immediately below are for the _most recent approved release_ of the Specification (which may be earlier than what is shown by the default branch on the GitHub repo). Links to other releases (tags) and other branches appear later in the page.
